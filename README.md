## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  I'm Joseph, a new grad based in New York City. I am a previous software engineer intern at Phoenix Bioinformatics, where I got to build skills developing features end-to-end.
  I am currently looking for a role where I can work as a full-stack software engineer or as a software engineer where JavaScript or Python is the main language. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on food market web app where it compares prices of grocery items between supermarkets
